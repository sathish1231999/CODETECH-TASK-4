Project Overview: Automated Sales Report Generation This project involves creating an automated report generation system using Python, which reads data from a CSV file, processes the data, generates a bar chart, and compiles everything into a PDF report.

Key Objectives: Data Handling:

The script reads sales data from a CSV file (sales_data.csv), which contains sales data by product, and processes it to summarize the total revenue by product. Data Visualization:

A bar chart is generated to visually represent the revenue of different products. The chart is saved as an image file (bar_chart.png). PDF Report Generation:

The report is created using the FPDF library in Python. It includes: A title. The generated bar chart. A summary of revenue by product. The report is saved as a PDF file (sales_summary_report.pdf). Workflow: CSV File: The script loads the CSV file, which contains two columns: Product and Revenue. Data Processing: The script groups the data by Product and calculates the sum of the Revenue for each product. Chart Generation: A bar chart is generated using the Matplotlib library, displaying the total revenue for each product. PDF Creation: A PDF report is generated using the FPDF library. The bar chart is inserted into the report, followed by a list of revenue summaries for each product. Final Output: The output includes two files: bar_chart.png – The visual chart. sales_summary_report.pdf – The comprehensive PDF report with the summary and chart. Technologies Used: Python Libraries:

Pandas: To read and process the CSV data. Matplotlib: To create the bar chart for visual representation. FPDF: To generate the PDF report. File Formats:

CSV: Used to store the raw data. PNG: Used for saving the chart image. PDF: Used for creating the final report.
